Welcome to Salon d'hiver where various artpieces are presented through the screen. I will lead you into a world of pure vision, bringing out your utmost visual and analytical capability. The first section, `Pure Looking` deals with what art historians call "formal analysis": observing the most basic visual qualities of an image without any inference to its representational meaning.
