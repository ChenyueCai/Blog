To Those Who Come By:

I am Chenyue Cai, currently a resident of the beautiful planet of earth and an active member of the cyber world. Yet, I spend about one-third of my time exploring in my own subconscious, yes, sleeping. While I am conscious and sober, I devote my energy to thinking and seeing the most. J'adore viewing art works, including paintings, photography, film pieces and digital art; I enjoy analyzing them also, decomposing works of art into formal elements while seeking uniformity and contradiction on a higher level. I also spend quite a lot of time and effort in thinking mathematical concepts and engineering problems related to vision. Apr√®s tout, **Je pense donc je suis**.
